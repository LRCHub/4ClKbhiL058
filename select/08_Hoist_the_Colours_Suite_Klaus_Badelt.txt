The King and his men
Stole the Queen from her bed
And bound her in her bones
The seas be ours and by the power
Where we will we'll roam

Yo ho, all hands
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die.

Yo ho, haul together,
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die

Yo ho, haul together,
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die
