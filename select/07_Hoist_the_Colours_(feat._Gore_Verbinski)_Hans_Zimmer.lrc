[00:18.88] The king and his men
[00:22.65] Stole the queen from her bed
[00:28.64] And bound her in her bones
[00:36.29] The seas be ours and by the powers
[00:46.14] Where we will, we'll roam
[00:58.64] 
[00:57.51] Yo, ho, haul together
[01:04.69] Hoist the colors high
[01:12.25] Heave ho, thieves and beggars
[01:19.73] Never shall we die
