[00:18.84] The king and his men
[00:22.69] Stole the queen from her bed
[00:28.69] And bound her in her bones
[00:36.23] The seas be ours and by the powers
[00:46.10] Where we will, we'll roam
[00:58.60] 
[00:57.56] Yo, ho, all together
[01:04.69] Hoist the colours high
[01:12.27] Heave, ho, thieves and beggars
[01:19.79] Never shall we die
